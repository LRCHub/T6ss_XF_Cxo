Tu-ru
Tu-ru-ru
Yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-yeah

I met her in the gift shop
Met her at the bus stop
Met her in the park fly
Looking like a show stop

Seemed to be a nice girl
Seemed to be a wise girl
Seemed to be a plain old
No surprise girl

So I was a bit surprised
Yes a little paralysed
When she started to undress me
With her steel blue eyes

Her breath so fast
I thought she wouldn't last
She ripped my shirt
And things got nasty

"Eat this! My kiss
Did you ever know
That it could feel like this"

Then she loved me
Bang!
Behind the bushes in the park
And I just went

Yum yum gimme some
(Yum yum gimme some)
A-ha-a-ha-a-ha-ha
Yum yum gimme some
(Tu-ru-tu-ru-ru)

So what you gonna do
What you gonna do

Yum yum gimme some
(Yum yum gimme some)

Yum yum gimme some

I'm on my knees
Well, so then it became next week
Feeling like a big geek
Tryin' to forget this psycho sex freak
I hoped to meet her someday
I did next sunday
I saw her in the park
I thought this'd be fun

She said "welcome to the club man
This is bob man 6'10" he is my husband"
The bitch was married!

She wanted to see me carried
Away on a stretcher
Severely harried

I 'm telling you all
He was pretty tall
He alone could fill a freakin' place
Like albert hall

"No kiss eat this
Did you ever know
That it could hurt like this"

Then he beat me Bang!
Behind the bushes in the park
Just because I'd been going

Yum yum gimme some
(Yum yum gimme some)
A-ha-a-ha-a-ha-ha
Yum yum gimme some
(Tu-ru-tu-ru-ru)
So what you gonna do
What you gonna do

Yum yum gimme some
(Yum yum gimme some)

Yum yum gimme some
Ouuh
Uh
Aw

Hit me

Sitting inside the bass trap
Feeling that bass slap
Hit me in the middle
Of my funky little face whap!

Feeling kinda funky
Not so hunky
Look like shit
Some low life junkie

Well, I learnt my lesson
I'll never start messing
Around with a girl
Who starts undressing
When you've known her for a minute
'Cause you never know what's in it
If she's wicked you may score
But you sure won't win no prize

Beware out there
Girls are rarely what they seem
And they don't care

So you got to remember this
The next when you feel like doing

Yum yum gimme some
(Yum yum gimme some)
A-hYum yum gimme some
(Tu-ru-tu-ru-ru)
So what you gonna do
What you gonna do

Yum yum gimme some
(Yum yum gimme some)

Yum yum gimme some

Bara-ba-ba-
Bappa-bada-ra
(Yum yum gimme some)
Bara-ba-barappa-pa

Bara-ba-ba-
Bappa-bada-ra
(Tu-ru-tu-ru-ru)
Bara-ba-barappa-pa
(Aiaiaiaiai...) a-a-ha-a-ha-ha
