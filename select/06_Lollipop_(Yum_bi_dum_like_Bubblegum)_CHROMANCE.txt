Look at me
I wake up and Im perfect
My hair, my nails
Im ready for your world
Life is great
As long as you are watching
Youre mine Im your's
Lets come up and never come down
Lookin good in the limelight
You wanna know what it tastes like
You're my sugar bum bum - and you want some
Baby me too
Yum bi dum like bubblegum
You blow me up and pop it
Hop up the tempo
Let the sugar roll
Come up and never come down
La di dub like lollipop
Just tap the lip and bop it
Hop up the tempo
Let the sugar roll
High up - high up
Yum bi dum like bubblegum
Hop up the tempo
Let the sugar roll
La di dub like lollipop
Hop up the tempo
Let the sugar roll
High up - high up
Yum bi dum like bubblegum
Hop up the tempo
Let the sugar roll
La di dub like lollipop
Hop up the tempo
Let the sugar roll
High up - high up
Thats a wrap
Another happy candy
You make me smile
Your puppet on a string
Row by row
The love is never ending
Youre mine Im yours
Let's come up and never come down
Lookin good in the limelight
You wanna know what it tastes like
You're my sugar bum bum - and you want some
Baby me too
Yum bi dum like bubblegum
You blow me up and pop it
Hop up the tempo
Let the sugar roll
Come up and never come down
La di dub like lollipop
Just tap the lip and bop it
Hop up the tempo
