I saw a white finger on a barbed wire fence
I knew it was dangerous but I took the risk
And yes it was sweet so sweet to eat
Now see how the flesh is pricked and bleeds
Yeah, it bleeds it bleeds, see how it bleeds
It bleeds, see how it bleeds
I saw a little baby crawling down the street
I said hey come over here baby
Cause you look beautiful to eat
I said come over, dear
You know what I'll do
Well I'll make you my mirror
Of the things that I chew
Little Yum-Yab little Yum-Yab
We are the wild we are the risk
Come little Yum-Yab come slash your wrist
We are the wild we are the risk
Come little Yum-Yab gimme a kiss
We are the wild we are the risk
Come little Yum-Yab come slash your wrist
We are the wild we are the risk
Come little Yum-Yab gimme a kiss
And blow your brains ah-out, ah ah-out
Ah-out
Blow your brains ah-out, ah ah-out, ah-out
And blow your brains ah-out, ah ah-out
Ah-out
I'll blow your brains ah-out, ah ah-out
Ah-out
Blow your brains ah-out, ah ah-out, ah-out
And blow your brains ah-out, ah ah-out
Ah-out
Now blow your brains ah-out, ah ah-out
Ah-out
Now blow your brains ah-out, ah ah-out
Ah-out
